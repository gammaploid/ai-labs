## Description
This directory contains the source code for Lab 2. The main file is a Jupyter Notebook `Lab02.ipynb` which explores and trains a Decision Tree Classifier on the Iris and PIMA Indians Diabetes datasets.

## Requirements
All required Python packages are listed in `requirements.txt`. To install them, run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
You will also need to have **Graphviz** installed on your system to visualize the decision trees. Please follow the installation instructions for your operating system from the official Graphviz website.

## How to Run
1.  Ensure you have installed the required packages from `requirements.txt` and that Graphviz is installed on your system.
2.  Open the Jupyter Notebook `Lab02.ipynb` in a compatible environment (like VS Code, Jupyter Lab, or Jupyter Notebook).
3.  Run the cells in the notebook sequentially to see the analysis and results.

## Known Bugs or Limitations
- The notebook will generate image files for the decision trees in the `Misc/` directory.
- There are no other known bugs at this time.
